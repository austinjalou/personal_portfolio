            <p>
                Hello world! My name is Austin Jalou. I was born in 1995, and I grew
                up and have lived in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan for my
                entire life. Although I am new to web development, and previously 
                do not have very much experience with it, I feel like I will do
                exceptionally well. I have a strong work ethic and a passion for
                learning new skills. I decided to take the online Coding Boot Camp
                course offered by Michigan State University for my own interest. 
                I did not originally plan on using this course to change my career 
                path, but after getting familiar with a few programming languages 
                and exploring the web development world, I have been considering 
                moving forward with a web development future. On this website you 
                will find a basic guide of some of my work as a beginner in web 
                development, as well as ways to get in contact with me.
            </p>
